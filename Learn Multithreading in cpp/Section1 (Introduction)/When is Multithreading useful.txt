When is multithreading useful?

Multithreading gives us asynchronous execution
This is where functions are not synchronized with each other.
THey can run at the same time.

1) When we are waiting for something external and we want to execute some code in the mean time

Example: pinging remote servers to get data collectively instead of getting data from pinging the servers one by one
        (assuming the data from the servers are independent from each other)

Example: drawing graphics while taking user input

2) Distributing processing across multiple cores
Eg: My CPU has 8 cores, So we can distribute the work in 8 cores which runs at the same time so that processing can be faster

Example: calculating pi to lots of digits

3) What is time-slicing?

Time-slice multithreading is the convectional multithreading where CPU creates an illusion of executing more than once program at a time 
but the CPU can execute only one of these programs at a time. 
The OS maintains the illusion of concurrency by rapidly switching between running programs at a fixed interval, called a time slice.
